			<h1><span class="num">1.</span>How do you get your investors a 7-12% return?*</h1>
			<p>Harvard and Yale have been investing in emerging asset classesoutside of stocks, bonds and annuities that are bringing in solid above average yields. Like Billionaire Sam Zell and LegendaryInvestor Warren Buffet, I too have discovered an investmentopportunity that produces immediate monthly cash flow andis not at the mercy of the stock market or economy. In fact,it was one of the few investments that continued to performvery well throughout the 2008 downturn and recession.</p>

				<p>The SEC has recently made it possible for individuals who now have a total net worth, outside theirprimary residence, of one million dollars or more, to participate. Today, I am pleased to welcome smart investors into the space once reserved for the ultra rich, a space in which I have personally invested tens of millions of my own money successfully.</p>

			<p>In business Iâ€™ve worked with top performers, presidents, celebrities, athletes, billionaires, and business owners like President George W. Bush, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, George Forman, Margaret Thatcher, and Donald Trump. In my personal investments, I have done the same. I vetted out the winners before opening my own fund. Now I can offer that value and experience to my investors.</p>
